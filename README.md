# ⚡ **SurgeGame**

**SurgeGame** is a **top-down, auto-attacking, roguelite arena survival** game inspired by *Vampire Survivors* and *Brotato*.
Battle relentless waves of enemies, collect powerful upgrades, and evolve your abilities to survive the **surge**.

Developed in **Godot 4** using **C#** as the main programming language, this project serves as our team’s **first full game** — a testing ground for learning, experimentation, and building solid development habits.

## **Current Status**
🧩 *Early Development Phase*
- Core movement and player combat logic in progress.
- Basic enemy spawning system being implemented.

## **Planned Features**
The vision for *SurgeGame* extends far beyond a prototype. Future features include:

✨ **Dynamic Upgrade System** – Unlock weapons, passives, and power-ups that stack into chaotic builds.  
⚡ **Elemental Synergies** – Combine electricity, fire, frost, or toxin-based upgrades for unique effects.  **Not Final**.  
🧍 **Multiple Characters** – Each with distinct stats, abilities, and playstyles.  **Not Final**.  
👾 **Wave Variety** – Enemies evolve, mutate, or swarm differently each run.  
🌩️ **Environmental Hazards** – Electric storms, collapsing structures, or energy surges that reshape the arena.  **Not Final**.
